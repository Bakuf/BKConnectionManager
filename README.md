# BKConnectionManager

This is a class I made to make request for rest web services, it includes a hud to display a message if you want to wait until you get the server response.

It can use blocks to download images or to make the oauth logic if you want. You can also make queues.

It has a little project to display how it works, it still need some work but for simple request is quite useful.

Enjoy =)
